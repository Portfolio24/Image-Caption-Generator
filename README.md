# Image Captioning System using CNN–LSTM
📌 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end image captioning system that automatically generates natural language descriptions for images using deep learning. The system follows a classical encoder–decoder architecture combining convolutional neural networks for visual understanding and recurrent neural networks for language generation.

🧠 Architecture

Encoder: Pre-trained VGG16 CNN used to extract high-level visual features from images

Decoder: LSTM-based sequence model to generate captions word-by-word

Training Strategy: Teacher forcing for stable and faster convergence

Inference Optimization: Top-k sampling to reduce repetitive and generic captions

📊 Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using BLEU scores (BLEU-1 to BLEU-4) along with qualitative inspection of generated captions. The system effectively captures objects, scene context, and basic attributes, producing grammatically correct and meaningful descriptions.

⚠️ Limitations

Limited recognition of complex or dynamic actions

Inaccurate object counting due to lack of explicit detection mechanisms

No attention mechanism, leading to reduced region-specific focus

Dataset bias affecting caption diversity and higher-order BLEU scores

🚀 Future Enhancements

Integrate attention mechanisms for improved visual focus

Replace LSTM with Transformer-based decoders

Explore multimodal models such as ViT, CLIP, or vision–language transformers

Incorporate object detection to improve counting accuracy
